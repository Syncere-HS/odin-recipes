        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>4 dried guajillo chiles, stemmed and seeded</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons achiote paste</li>
                <li>6 large cloves garlic, peeled</li>
                <li>1 (7 ounce) can chipotle peppers in adobo sauce, drained</li>
                <li>1 ⅓ cups finely chopped onion, divided</li>
                <li>⅔ cup orange juice</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons apple cider vinegar</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
                <li> tablespoon ground cumin</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon light brown sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                <li>3 pounds skinless, boneless chicken thighs, cut in half</li>
                <li>8 (12-inch) jumbo wooden skewers</li>
                <li>1 large fresh pineapple - peeled, cored, and sliced</li>
                <li>20 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>
                <li>¼ cup roughly chopped fresh cilantro</li>
             </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add dried chiles; cook, turning occasionally, until toasted and blistered in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Add 1 cup water to just cover the chiles, and bring to a simmer over medium-high. Cover and cook, undisturbed, until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain well.


            </li>
            <li>
                Combine chiles, achiote, garlic, chipotles, 2/3 cup onion, orange juice, vinegar, oil, cumin, brown sugar, and salt in a blender; process until smooth, about 30 seconds. Reserve 1/2 cup marinade, cover, and refrigerate until ready to use.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place remaining marinade in a shallow dish or large resealable plastic bag, add chicken; toss to evenly coat. Cover chicken with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place wooden skewers in a shallow dish; cover with water by 1 inch. Let stand at room temperature while chicken marinates.
            </li>
            <li>
                Thread 1 pineapple slice onto 2 skewers, being sure to pierce through the center core, (skewers will be about 1 inch apart), leaving a 1 1/2-inch space from end of skewer. Thread 5 to 6 pieces of marinated chicken, stacking on top of pineapple; thread 1 pineapple slice. Repeat process, ending with pineapple slice, until all chicken pieces and pineapple slices are used, making 4 stacks total. Brush with any remaining marinade from chicken.
            </li>
            <li>
                Place stacked skewers in the prepared pan, resting skewer ends on edge of pan so that the chicken doesn't touch the bottom of the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes. Flip skewers over, brush with reserved 1/2 cup marinade. Bake until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes longer. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 160 degrees F (71 degrees C). Increase oven temperature to broil; broil until browned and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and broil until browned and crispy, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Remove chicken and pineapple from skewers, place on cutting board, roughly chop.
             </li>
             <li>
                Divide chicken and pineapple between heated tortillas; top with remaining onion and cilantro.
             </li>
        </ul>
